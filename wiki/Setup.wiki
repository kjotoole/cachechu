== Requirements ==
  # The following paths require write (and read) access:
    * data/`<`network>/bans.dat
    * data/`<`network>/hosts.dat
    * data/`<`network>/urls.dat
    * data/update.dat (if update notification enabled)
    Replace `<`network> by the networks you support.
  # The following paths MAY require write (and read) access, depending on configuration:
    * data/bans.dat
    * data/hosts.dat
    * data/urls.dat
  # The following file should be set as the directory index:
    * index.php
  # To enable stat logging, the following files should exist:
    * data/stats.dat
    * data/start.dat
  # If your host cannot test clients on a port other than 80, the following configuration should *not* be present:
{{{
[Host]
Verify = 1
}}}

  # To disable the Web interface, the following configuration should be present:
{{{
[Interface]
Show = 0
}}}
  # To disable info pages on the Web interface, the following configuration should be present:
{{{
[Interface]

  # Hosts shows the country (if GeoIP present), IP, port, client, timestamp, and age of hosts for each network.
  # Services shows the country (if GeoIP present), URL, IP, client, timestamp of caches for each network.

==Compatibility==
  Cachechu has been tested under PHP 5.3.0.
